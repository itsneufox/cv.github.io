  "name": "João Lopes Frias",
  "descriptions": [
    "Software developer and industrial production manager who bridges the factory floor with the digital ecosystem. I turn warehouse routines and production-line challenges into products and tools that solve real problems for both technical and operational teams.",
    "My current focus is TypeScript, React, and automation—shipping everything from CLIs such as tapi to VS Code extensions and libraries for the open.mp/SA-MP community. I stay involved across the lifecycle: product ideation, DX, documentation, localization, and community support.",
    "Comfortable with high-pressure logistics environments, I lead crews, streamline material flows, and enforce safety/quality standards—whether I’m operating forklifts or rolling out new software. That blend of physical operations and engineering gives me a pragmatic edge when building products."
